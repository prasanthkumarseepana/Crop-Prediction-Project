# Crop-Prediction-Project

This a prediction system project where I have used five models- Decision Tree, Logit Regression, SVM, Random Forest and Gaussian NB to predict which crop can be cultivated in a given farm provided the nutrient distribution of soil, temperature and humidity in the farm.

The maximum accuracy achieved was 99% using Random Forest and Naive Bayes Classifier.
